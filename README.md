**IMAGE PROCESSING GUI with MATLAB**

The purpose of this project is to modify images by implementing all
subjects of Image Processing and Understanding how the process of
modifying Image works by using code.
The scope of this program is :
- Basic Operation
- Image Transformation
- Image Enhancement

STEP-BY-STEP TO RUN THE PROGRAM ON YOUR COMPUTER :
1. First, you need to Download and Install Matlab in your computer. The display should look like this :

2. Download Code GUI_BS.m and GUI_BS.fig from our github page

3. Click "guide" then click open existing file, find the directory path that contains GUI_BS.fig

4 .Our fig template will looks like this. To check if fig is working properly or not, try to click the green triangle to run the program

5. The program that runs the GUI_BS.fig is GUI_BS.m, all the codes are already there, you can modify the code to suit your needs. If the program works properly, you can try to import an image and then try to manipulate the image with all available functions on the GUI

6. For example, I've imported an image and then want to manipulate the orginial image to become a Black & White Image

7. Just click the Black & White Button to start manipulating

8. Lastly, if you want to download the manipulated image just click the save image button and download it to your local computer
